== ABOUT ==
This PHP extension allows you to find the location of an IP address - City, State, 
Country, Longitude, Latitude, and other information as all, such as ISP and connection type.

To compile it, you will need to have the GeoIP c library installed.

Forked from pecl.php.net/package/geoip (1.0.7)


== CHANGELOG ==
* Added geoip_netspeedcell_by_name
* Added geoip_domain_by_name
* Added geoip_asnum_by_name
* Added geoip_country_code_by_addr
* Added geoip_country_code3_by_addr
* Removed NOTICE errors when adress isn't found, returning FALSE is enough
* Added geoip_setup_custom_directory
* PHP 5.4 compatibility
